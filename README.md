# Rage of Empire

Rage of Empire is a game aspiring to recreate the experience of the glorious Age of Empires II, but in the browser.

The motivations of such an adventure are mostly the technical challenge, but also come from my frustration of running AoE2
my Linux desktop and my MacBookPro.

## Vision

My ambitions for Rage of Empire is for it to become an open source and portable version of Age of Empires II. 

But also to become a great open source game, where a community can contribut assets and ideas.

## TODO

This list contains important features has to be _done right_ (according to my humble opinion).

(NOTE: I prefer the use _terrain_ over _map_, because of the amguity with a well known data structure.)

- Sprits animation
- Terrain representation format (Probably a huge 8 bits matrix. With the first 6 telling the terrain texture (dessert, grass, water, etc...) and 2 last for _walkable_ and _navigatable_.)
- Terrain rendering (It's really like... A texture of textures???)
- _Snapshot loading_ (When a new player has to download the whole state of the game)
- Server architecture
- And more...
